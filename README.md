# Data science portfolio by Jose Ortigosa Ferris

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. A separate category is for separate projects.

## Machine learning projects.

### California Housing prices

In this project I am trying to predict the housing prices in California using features like the age of the house or  its proximity to the ocean. For this project I used a simple linear regression and the XGboost method.

the code can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/joseconomy/california-housing-prices-regression-under-work).

## Exploratory Data Analysis.

### Accidents in UK

## Deep learning projects

### Credit card fraud detector
Manipulating a database of 300.000 transactions made with a credit card, the objective of this project is to create a deep neural network that classify the transactions in fraudulent or normal transaction. 

the code can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/joseconomy/credit-card-fraud-dnn).
